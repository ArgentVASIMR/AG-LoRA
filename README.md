# Furry Diffusion LoRA Training 
This repository is for the antrogent lora trainer by antrobot and argentVASIMR. This is a work-in-progress total conversion from using powershell scripts to using direct python logic and yaml files.

While this repository is currently technically usable, it is far from feature-complete, so use it and your own risk.

## documentation

TODO: This section will describe how to set up and use this project. rough outline for now:
1. install sd-scripts
2. install this trainer
3. edit the launch.bat/bash files to point to the sd-scripts install
4. edit the directories yaml to point to the model install, dataset, and output folder locations.
5. run using the bat/bash scripts.
