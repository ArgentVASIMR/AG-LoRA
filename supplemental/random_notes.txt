i did a run with [network dropout 0.3 and scale norms 0] and one with scale norms 3 and net dropout [0], usually scale norms didn't cause too many issues but network dropout 0.3 made it fairly lobotomized

2000 [steps] is a good starting point for evaluation ofc but go in with no expectations

the "dreambooth" slash "correct" method is to [matching filenames for dataset images and pripres images] but it was thought up as a method for training photorealistic models
as far as i can tell it's probably a lot less effective with the models we have because they are not stylistically homogenous
we are also in the unique position though of knowing pretty certainly the dataset the models were trained on
so you could totally just scrape images related to the training subject as [regularization/prior preservation]
the filename doesnt matter though
never did
